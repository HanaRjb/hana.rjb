abstract: One of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteins is lysine malonylation, which affects cell function. To reveal the mechanisms of cellular functions, it is necessary to identify the site of malonylation in proteins. Methods based on machine learning solutions have been proposed, which reduce costs and time complexity and increase accuracy. However, these approaches still have shortcomings. This research shows that about finding the malonylation site in proteins, and how to achieve favorable results by using the natural language processing approach, and word frequency - category correlation coefficient. The proposed method was implemented and executed by relevant specialized functions in the Python environment. The cross-validation results show the good performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the XGBOOST and random forest classifiers were superior to other classifiers, indicating the effectiveness of the features generated by the proposed scheme.
