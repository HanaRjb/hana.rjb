abstract: This research fills a scientific gap by addressing the challenge of identifying the site of Malanylation in proteins. It highlights the importance of efficient solutions that reduce execution time and improve output accuracy. The study introduces a novel framework for extracting informative features from protein functional domains. Multiple classifiers are utilized for prediction and experimental results indicate that the CRF-Mal method outperforms other approaches. Notably, the XG Boost classifier demonstrates superior performance compared to alternative classifiers.
